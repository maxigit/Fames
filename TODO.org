* TODO TDD [/]
** Refactor Receipt code if needed
** Chuck all code away and rewrite from scratch.
Maybe move hamlet in separate file
* TODO
** General
- [ ] create roles and permissions
permission :: Role -> Feature -> Authorised Yes/No
- [ ] general config (code).
plugin or hardcoded ?

** GL
- [ ] create event rules
- [ ] create FA transaction class
*** VAT problem
Enter all payment receipt in a easy way

InputFormat -> [FATransaction]
*** TODO Process Receipts Use cases [0/3]
**** TODO User need a spreadsheet templates
**** TODO User upload a new spreadsheet
Either upload a file or upload text via text input.
***** TODO Check format (syntax) is valid [0/4]
- [ ] column names are correct
- [ ] type of column correct
example integer, float, string, non null etc ..
- [ ] accept valid
- [ ] reject invalid
  - [ ] or save for later
  Ideally we would like to be able to save the full things
and process what is correct. 

***** TODO Check semantic is valid
- [ ] bank account exists
- [ ] totals add up
- [ ] Taxes add up
- [ ] all information are there
- [ ] transform to event
*****  TODO Check events are correct
validate which one are correct
***** TODO  process correct events
*****  TODO Modify events until correct
unvalid event can be skipped for later
***** TODO push correct all correct even to FA
We probably need a bulk and individual push options
**** TODO User upload an existing spreadsheet
A user should be able to reupload a spread which
which either contained invalid colum or has been modified

To do so, we need to be able to track the fact that the same sheet was similar.
ie have an unique identifier per document (user ?)

We should also be able to track different version of the same document
and keep its history.

The best is probably to have a general document mechanism, allowing us to save
"everything" and ideally have a diff mechanism (with or without semantic).

Maybe document could be converted from untyped to "something" (ex invoice, PL, receipts)

***** Compute difference with previous version
The previous version of the document can have event which are valid and even
have been validated and successfully commited to FA.
The system should be able to ignore those and find the difference in order
to only regenerate events which needs to be.

Finding events which haven't changed it's easy (even if they don't appear in the
same order). Modified one will have to be seen as deleted and created. (finding 
modification might be tricky and useless anyway)
* Documents
User should be able to store multiple version of (any) document
and then process them with the appropriate action.

We should also have a shortcut to upload and process a document.

We need permission on document and documents types.







*  Done
- [X] allow file to be parsed.
This is the priority as it allows manual testing much easier

- [X] fix invalid row from invalid header field
- [X] fix duplicated rows
- [X] fix test ?
** DONE Add all columns
CLOSED: [2016-05-30 Mon 21:21]
- [X] modify code
- [X] modify test
** TODO refactor multi column names
** DONE fix transform
CLOSED: [2016-05-30 Mon 21:21]
Transforming row is not safe (Maybe Int) -> Int. Check why it's needed
** DONE refactor handler to accept flow
** DONE finalize tests
** DONE pre-process header
So we can use Date, date, DATE etc ...
- [ ] +DRY columns list and those in the parser+
- [ ] +find an alternative library+
- [ ] +write my own bit+
Solution, just try them explicitly using =asum=
** DONE add encoding options
** DONE Upload via file
CLOSED: [2016-04-03 Sun 13:47]
** TODO Think of a/the flow
Each steps should be able to have it's own page or not ...
- [ ]  MAYBE add steps  in URL
- [ ] split handler into function and dispatch (and pass error/parsing result)
** DONE Generate event from receipt
CLOSED: [2016-04-03 Sun 11:33]
keep receipt together so we can display both
- guess VAT
* Next
** TODO use FA user as login
** TODO add Roles and Permissions
because some tables shouldn't be accessible
The easiest is probably to create roles (hiearchy ?) and assing user to them (hardcoded).
** TODO lookup bank account, gl account etc ...
*** TODO how to do private conf ?
** TODO validate and create full receipt
** TODO add Uknown/Calculated/Given monad
** TODO parse VAT ex : Te0
** TODO replace FA routes by ones with sub type
