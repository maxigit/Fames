Allow stocktake without barcode.
similar to 0 takes but doesn't
For example if 24 of a styles are in stock
but only 5 are checked.
We don't want to invalidate the last stocktake (and not the box)
as it's indicate where (location and barcode) are the styles
if needs to be.
However, those items won't be taken into account when calculating 
stock adjustement if they have been already adjusted.

In fact, a stocktake can be seen as a queue for pending adjustement.
The real information where things are is in the boxtake table.

* Features
** TODO Stock Adjustment [0/2]
*** TODO Generate stock adjustment from stock take amendment [0/2]
- [ ] Generate the diff
between the stock adj saved in db and the one which 
should be generated from the actual stocktake.

The new adj should set the parent to the original

 - [ ] add *parent* field in stock_adjustement
 - [ ] find all descendant
When comparing expeced adj with one in DB , we need to not only 
check for the adj to amend but also to all it's descendant and possibly ascendant.
Basically, all adjustments related to the original one should be loaded and taken into consideration.
** TODO Items
Allows to create an update new variations.
** Design
The main page displays the (outer) cross product between selected styles and selected colours (from style)
This done by filtering variations by regexp or SQL like expression the style and the colours.
The first variations selected represent the style to overview, the second variations represent the colour to look at.
For example the first selection returns

| T-Shirt | Black |
| T-Shirt | Blue  |
| Cap     | Black |

This correspond to T-Shirt and Cap[


and the second selection returns
| Hat | Black |
| Hat | Red |
This correspond to Black and Red.

The *cross product* will be

| T-Shirt | Black | Present |
| T-Shirt | Blue | Extra |
| T-Shrit | Red | Missing |
| Cap | Black | Present |
| Cap | Red | Missing |


T-Shirt-Red and Cap-Rep are *missing*. T-Shirt blue is *extra* as not part of the selected colours.
However Cap-Blue is not displayed as blue is not an expected colors


* Bugs

** Drupal Commerce borked
Delete Website items doesn't work if people have a pending order
There is a link between commerce_line_item and the product
via field_data_commerce_product
The following query shouldn't return anything
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select * from dcx_field_data_commerce_product where commerce_product_product_id = 75661 limit 10
select dcx_commerce_line_item.* from dcx_field_data_commerce_product
left join dcx_commerce_product p on(product_id = commerce_product_product_id)
left join dcx_commerce_line_item on(entity_id = line_item_id)
where p.sku is NULL
#+END_SRC

If the database is corrupted we can either fix field_data_commerce_product manually
by looking at the sku in commerce_line_item and find the correct product_id in commerce_product.

The easiest however, is just to delete all commerce_line_item and then delete the order from the 
DC order interface.
