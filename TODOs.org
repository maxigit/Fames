* Web status missing
Web items need 
- product variation
- prices
- link
When creating missing, we need of course
to create all, but prices only can be missing,
or link only 
** Added manually to make it work
- set revision_id in field_data_field_product
Revision is for the product display 
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
 update field_data_field_product set revision_id = 208 where field_product_product_id = 211943

#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC  sql
  insert into field_revision_field_product
  value ('node', 'product_display', 0, 207, 208, 'und', 24, 211943)

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
 insert into commerce_product_revision 
 (product_id, sku, title, revision_uid, status)
 VALUE (211943,'ML16-CF9-CAO', 'ML16-CF9 (Cameo)', 1, 1)

#+END_SRC

 When refreshing a page "Search" checkbox and style are not in synck

 It makes sense, since if we change the filter, the already checked box are not
 relevant anymore.

Allow stocktake without barcode.
similar to 0 takes but doesn't
For example if 24 of a styles are in stock
but only 5 are checked.
We don't want to invalidate the last stocktake (and not the box)
as it's indicate where (location and barcode) are the styles
if needs to be.
However, those items won't be taken into account when calculating 
stock adjustement if they have been already adjusted.

In fact, a stocktake can be seen as a queue for pending adjustement.
The real information where things are is in the boxtake table.

* Features
** TODO Stock Adjustment [0/2]
*** TODO Generate stock adjustment from stock take amendment [0/2]
- [ ] Generate the diff
between the stock adj saved in db and the one which 
should be generated from the actual stocktake.

The new adj should set the parent to the original

 - [ ] add *parent* field in stock_adjustement
 - [ ] find all descendant
When comparing expeced adj with one in DB , we need to not only 
check for the adj to amend but also to all it's descendant and possibly ascendant.
Basically, all adjustments related to the original one should be loaded and taken into consideration.
** TODO Items
Allows to create an update new variations.
** Design
The main page displays the (outer) cross product between selected styles and selected colours (from style)
This done by filtering variations by regexp or SQL like expression the style and the colours.
The first variations selected represent the style to overview, the second variations represent the colour to look at.
For example the first selection returns

| T-Shirt | Black |
| T-Shirt | Blue  |
| Cap     | Black |

This correspond to T-Shirt and Cap[


and the second selection returns
| Hat | Black |
| Hat | Red |
This correspond to Black and Red.

The *cross product* will be

| T-Shirt | Black | Present |
| T-Shirt | Blue | Extra |
| T-Shrit | Red | Missing |
| Cap | Black | Present |
| Cap | Red | Missing |


T-Shirt-Red and Cap-Rep are *missing*. T-Shirt blue is *extra* as not part of the selected colours.
However Cap-Blue is not displayed as blue is not an expected colors
