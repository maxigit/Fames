** TODO Stock Adjustment [0/1]
*** TODO Generate stock adjustment from stock take admeendet [0/2]
- [ ] Generate the diff
between the stock adj saved in db and the one which 
should be generated from the actual stocktake.

The new adj should set the parent to the original

 - [ ] add *parent* field in stock_adjustement
 - [ ] find all descendant
When comparing expeced adj with one in DB , we need to not only 
check for the adj to amend but also to all it's descendant and possibly ascendant.
Basically, all adjustments related to the original one should be loaded and taken into consideration.
